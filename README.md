# nuptfer

__Nuptiality and Fertility Models__

`nuptfer` is an R package with functions implementing classic
demographic models of nuptiality and fertility, including the
Coale-McNeil and Hernes models of entry into first union, and 
the Henry, Coale, and Coale-Trussell models of natural, marital
and general fertility.

Install the package directly from GitHub by first installing 
Hadley Wickman's `devtools` package and then calling the 
function `install_github("grodri/nuptfer")`.  

For an equivalent set of Stata functions, including extensions to 
`egen` and a Mata library, use the Stata command `net from http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/stata`. Documentation is available 
[here](http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/nuptfer.html)
