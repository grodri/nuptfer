# nuptfer
Nuptiality and Fertility Models

An R package with functions implementing demographic models of nuptiality and fertility, 
including the Coale-McNeil and Hernes models of entry into first union and the Henry, 
Coale, and Coale-Trussell models of natural, marital and general fertility.

Install directly from GitHub by first installing the `devtools` package and then trying
`install_github("grodri/nuptfer").  

For a similar set of Stata functions including extensions to `egen` and a Mata library
use the command `net from http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/stata`. Documentation is
available (on my website)[http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/stata/nuptfer.html].
