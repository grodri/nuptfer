Description: This package includes several functions useful in the
    analysis of fertility and nuptiality, including probabilities,
    quantiles and random numbers from the Coale-McNeil and Hernes
    models of marriage, as well as marital and general fertility rates
    from the Coale and Coale-Trussell models. All functions take as
    lead argument a vector of exact ages, which in the case of fertility
    are used to interpolate in tables of single-year model values.
